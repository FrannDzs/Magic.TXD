Before creating any installation package please build the entire
repository in 32bit and 64bit release mode (VS2015).

To create a NSIS installation package you have to download
and install the official NSIS, Nullsoft Scriptable Installation System.

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download

Run the .nsi file with that tool. It comes with an .exe builder.
